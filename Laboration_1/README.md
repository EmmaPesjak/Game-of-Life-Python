# Laboration 1
Emma Pesjak 2021-09-08
## Environment & Tools
The laboration was performed on a Windows 10 PC with PyCharm 2021.2.1, Python 3.9.7 and Git version 2.33.0.windows.2. 
The sources of information used for this laboration has been course literature
(chapter 2 in Pro Git, second edition and chapter 5 and 8 in Python Basics, fourth edition) 
and lecture videos by Corey Shafer, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4) 
and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZwmZ8Usvnk).
## Purpose
One purpose of laboration 1 was to get an understanding of how Git works and to use some very useful basic commands
like initializing a repository, branching, pushing and pulling from remote repositories and committing changes.
Another purpose was to be introduced to Python and to learn some basic mathematical and boolean coding.
## Procedures
Part one of the laboration was fairly straight forward, having gone through the course material, 
I directly understood that 'B' was a string and needed the int(B) function, and C was a float and needed to be an int(C) aswell.
This could have been an issue for the code otherwise.
Part two was a bit trickier, and I had to go back to the course material to figure out how to solve it.
## Discussion
The purpose has been fulfilled, the code works, and I have managed to understand how Git works and why it is a very useful tool.
In my opinion, this was a great starting exercise for this course. I had basically no previous knowledge of Git or Python (or codning at all for that matter).
The learning modules contained all the information needed, great references to the course literature, articles and videos, different types of learning material is always appreciated. 
It was a little daunting at first, with all the new information, and it took some time to figure things out. 
As a distance student, I would however appreciate some sort of laboratory/question-session each week, 
doesn't have to be long but just some short walk through of the module of the week or a time to ask a few questions.
