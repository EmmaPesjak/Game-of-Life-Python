## Purpose

## Procedures

## Discussion







parse_world_size_arg
had trouble with wrong error message when empty string from .split
assert was hard to grasp since it is "backwards thinking".

completed the base implementations 
populate_world

calc_neighbour_positions
this was the most straigt forward function, basically nothing hard, just make a list of tuples of neighbours
am aware that it could be done in one line but thought it was better to list all  N, NW, E, SE.... for readability


run_simulation
also pretty straight forward

update_world
None cells easy fix
tricky to get the neighbours count right for next gen

count_alive_neighbours


grade d recursive
the guidance did not specify if to use memoization in the recursive function, but since we learned 
in lab 3 that it is faster...


furthermore...
